An annotation is a necessary part of every chart, it can be used to either give a general description or emphasize key observations from the data. Annotations are helpful to enrich a narrative. Compared with other genres, for examples it is less complex in terms of the layouts of different objectives than poster and flow chart, it is more interactive than magazine style.<br>\n",

If all pictures are in uniform style in color, size and caption, etc., it's fine to give display a narrative visualization, but if not, viewers are liable to lose the path to follow the story-telling. Usually we think the more important the part is, the bigger picture it should be shown in. Therefore when using comic strip, we should consider more about how to balance the layout of the whole page and emphasis of the story itself.<br>\n",
