​    These days we are hearing a lot about COVID-19. As the virus has spread through out the world, there is no doubt that the virus has large human consequences. But as the virus has closed down large parts of societies all over the world, the consequences are now readable in most aspects of our life. When the situation of the world change that drastically, it inevitably affects the financial situation. However the effect are not always simple. When we are forced to change our behavior so radically, the demand changes with it, to reflect the new situation. To better understand the new situation we have all found ourselves in, we will here take a look at how the financial markets have been influenced.

​    Let's first take a look at how COVID-19 has spreed in selected countries over time.

The growth rate of of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is initially higher in China, while a rapid growth can be observed in the counties of Europe from the middle of March and they ended up with the highest number of confirmed cases. It shows how powerful the virus is, and who it has affected countires across the world.

## The national perspective
To get a understanding of how the financial situation have been devloping, we focus on how the price the leading stock indexes have been developing since since the begining of 2020.

The development overall matches with the development of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, with the drastic drop in stock prices happening at the same time as the increases in number of confirmed cases can be observed. Towards the end of the observed period, the development of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases appear to begin to stabilize, which corresponds well with the stabilization with can be observed for the stock prices towards the end of the period as well.

While a clear difference can be observed in the development of number of confirmed cases within the different contries, it is not that easy to distinguish between the development of the stock markets. Overall no clear connection can be observed between the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases registered within a country, and how strongly the stock marked appear to have been affected. For instance Denmark and China appear to have a less drastic changed in stock prices in the period where the other countries have experienced a large decrease, while Australia with a relatively low number of confirmed cases did experience a decrease comparable to what can be observed for the US, even though a much large number of COVID-19 cases was confirmed for US.



## Understanding the effect across industries

​    Since this pandemic broke out, governments have been taking unprecedented measures to slow it down. This have definitely had a severe effect on the economy system in every country, as was made clear in the previous section. In the section, the focus is on the performance of companies in the stock markets and to try to figure out to what extend different companies' operation have been affected by the Coronavirus. Many public companies' stock prices plummet while others benefited from this special situation.

The above visualization clearly shows that four companies have finincially benefited from the way the marked has changed during COVID-19, as their accumulated changes are positive. These companies are Yiling Medicine, Netflix, Amazon and Justeat. Yiling Medicine has benefited the most from COVID-19, as the accumulated fluctuation over the past four months is more than 100%. The accumulated increase for Netflix, Amazon and Justeat are still positive, but lower at 24.93%, 18.86% and 9.05%.

​    In terms of the negative effects of COVID-19, airlines seemed to suffer most. There were accumulated drops of 64.23% and 29.92%  for SAS and Ryan airline. The Entertainment industry appear to be the second most negativly affected industry. Disney lost 27.23% in total and Tivoli lost 9.54%. The performance of the food industry varied based on their categories, for example, the takeaway business Justeat thrived, but restaurants like McDoloads was affected. This could be because most McDoloads restaurants have their own take-away service, therefore they didn't suffer a lot by COVID-19 with a small drop of 2.91%.
