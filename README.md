​    These days we are hearing a lot about COVID-19. As the virus has spread through out the world, there is no doubt that the virus has large human consequences. But as the virus has closed down large parts of societies all over the world, the consequences are now readable in most aspects of our life. When the situation of the world change that drastically, it inevitably affects the financial situation. However the effect are not always simple. When we are forced to change our behavior so radically, the demand changes with it, to reflect the new situation. To better understand the new situation we have all found ourselves in, we will here take a look at how the financial markets have been influenced.

​    Let's first take a look at how number ofCOVID-19 affect selected countries along with selected time range by the growth of confirmed cases on a Heatmap movie. The growth rate of China is higher than others at beginning of time range, while counties of Europe had a rapider growth from the middle of March and they ended up with the highest increasing confirmed cases. It shows how powerful the virus is, and we can assume a huge impact in financial markets will appear very soon.

## The national perspective
​    Next step we would take an initial look at how the percentage of stock markets changing, for the selected countries, have been developing since October 2019, it is clear that from the start of March the price started to drop, across all countries. 

​    The development overall matches with  the development of the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, with the drastic drop in stock prices happening as the increases in number of cases can be observed.  Towards the end of the observed period the development of number of confirmed COVID-19 cases appear to begin to stabilize, which corresponds well with the stabilization with can be observed for the stock prices towards the end of the period as well.

​    However,there **cannot be observed a clear connection** between how strongly the stock marked appear to have been affected, and how many confirmed cased of COVID-19 have been registered within the country. For instance Denmark and China appear to have a less drastic changed in stock prices in the period where the other countries have experienced a large decrease, while Australia with a relatively low number of confirmed cases did experience a decrease comparable to what can be observed for the US, even though a much large number of COVID-19 cases was confirmed for US.

​    **This part could be modified better to connected with previous stock markets plot**

​    Again the line plot of COVID-19  confirmed cases clearly illustrate the comparison of  different countries. We can observe that the confirmed cases in China start increasing earlier than all the other counties. At the end of February the increasing tendency hit the peak in China and remain stable for the rest of time. Compared to China,the first confirmed cases as recorded for other countries comes up among end of February. As the time goes on,the confirmed cases increasing with different rate. There are 8 countries showing a fast reaction and controlling the spread of corona virus better then others. The reason could be complicated, but some bold reasons may be concluded as their small population, warmer season,geographic location and so on. On the other hand, the confirmed cases in countries like Spain and Italy increasing more rapidly given a sharper curve.

## Understanding the effect across industries

​    Since this pandemic broke out, governments have been taking unprecedented measures to slow it down. This have definitely had a severe effect on the economy system in every country, as was made clear in the previous section. In the section, the focus is on the performance of companies in the stock markets and to try to figure out to what extend different companies' operation have been affected by the Coronavirus. Many public companies' stock prices plummet while others benefited from this special situation.
